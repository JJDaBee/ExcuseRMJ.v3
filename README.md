Project Voluntherapy is a website that connects has scheduling capabilities to link up potential volunteers who would like to help in assisting the elderly with their telemedicine sessions. For volunteers new to the programme, they will be required to sign up for a one-day training through a calendar that our website will offer, through which we plan to pair volunteers who are free and elderly who have a telemedicine session together.

Volunteers will then help the elderly set up their telemedicine sessions and assist them during the session by ensuring the exercises and techniques are done properly according to the physiotherapist.

On the health institution end, the nurses will fill in the necessary details of the patient and help to schedule the physiotherapy sessions for the elderly and upload it onto the website. They will also be in charge of making sure all the necessary information about their medicine routine is uploaded onto the database so that the watch will remind them when to take the medicine.

With our website, we will make the telemedicine physiotherapy sessions more productive and meaningful as the elderly will now not only get guided assistance from trained individuals, but the doctors and nurses who are overworked are able to conduct these sessions remotely, cutting down time. Additionally, it serves as a simpler platform that allows students to find these volunteering opportunities much more easily.
